# UFO Sightings: Fact of Fancy?

## Description
Create a website with a dynamic table filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape using Javascript.  This was accomplished by creating a a function named filterTable(). This set the filtered data to the table and looped through all of the filters and keep any data that matches the filter values.

## Technology Used
We built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. We created filters to make this table fully dynamic, it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file.  We customized our webpage using Bootstrap, and fill our table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations.  We employ the ES6 capabilities to utilize arrow functions.  

## Recommendations
We could go further and expand our table and filters to include duration and the ability to search the comments field for key words such that pertain to color, direction, and location in the sky.
